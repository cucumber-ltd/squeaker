# Squeaker

Squeaker is a simple Rails app that was written by the participants of one of my training courses.

If you want to see it in action, it runs at http://squeaker.heroku.com

I use Squeaker for demonstration purposes, particularly as part of my [BDD training courses](http://blog.mattwynne.net/2011/08/24/bdd-training/)
